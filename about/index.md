# About TAK PI
{: .no_toc}

TAK Project Index (TAK PI) is just a simple hub for some of [@trabdlkarim](https://github.com/trabdlkarim){:traget="_blank"} most important software development projects. You can think of it as a personal development lab with various projects that you could customize for your own use upon downloading.

## TAK Project Index

The TAK PI projects are mainly a collection of Python development projects that are independently developed by [Toure A. Karim](https://rabdlkarim.com){:traget="_blank"}. TAK PI is a community-driven organization with the goal to maintain and improve those projects.

The purpose of TAK PI is to provide a home for the individual projects so that users have a central place to go to to report bugs, provide patches and get releases. The idea of the TAK Project is to be an inclusive community around the projects that all live and breathe by the same rules to make the projects less dependent on the original author without compromising the design ideas behind them.

## Structure

TAK PI does not have a strong structure yet and maybe that will not change. The head of the information organization is Toure A. Karim and potentially controversial decisions are signed off through him.

### Decision Making Process
{: .my-5}

The purpose of the TAK Project Index is primarily to reduce the risk of the projects to depend too much on a single person and secondly to document the otherwise very opaque processes a bit. All important decisions will still be made by Toure A. Karim until a better structure emerges naturally but ideally most problems fall into categories that are well enough covered by the Governance section of this website.

### External Services
{: .my-5}

We learned the hard way with the projects that reliance on external services can both be a huge maintenance burden as well as be a great help in avoiding to have to maintain a bunch of services ourselves. As such the process going forward is to absolutely embrace external services for as long as we know how to migrate off them if necessary and that we're sufficiently convinced that they are well run. For instance we're very happy to be reliant on GitHub, Travis-CI and other services for code hosting and similar things.



### Permissions

The permission structure is managed on GitHub which is our primary home for the project. In particular it also shows who can commit to different projects and how.
