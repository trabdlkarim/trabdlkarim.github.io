## How Can I Contribute?

### Did you find a bug?
{: .mb-5}

- Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability, and instead send us [a security feedback]({% link feedback/index.md %}).

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report template to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description.

### Pull Requests
{: .mb-5}

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Projects' quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages)
2. Follow the project's programming language official styleguide
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/){:target="_blank"} are passing

**What if the status checks are failing?**

If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

### Git Commit Messages
{: .mb-5}

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * `:memo:` when writing docs
    * `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
{: .mb-5}

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the **Pull Request** description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please be sure you used the right coding conventions and benchmarks.

### Suggesting Enhancements
{: .mb-5}

**Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change by sending us [an enhancement suggestion feedback]({% link feedback/index.md %})

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
